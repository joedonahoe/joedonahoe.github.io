			<div class="repoNote">I was really happy with how this visualization worked out, and it looks good six months later.  Unlike some of my earlier fantasy sports analysis, I polished these vizzes off with my own conclusion.  The addition of the informed conclusions make the "story" work better for the consumer on the first glance, and the graphic assists with deeper data-gazing.</div>

			<div class="repoNote">A viz I built for a fantasy basketball league sometime in late 2012.  It is hosted on Tableau Public.  This shows which fantasy categories (points, field goal percentage, steals, etc.) a team is doing well or not-so-well in.  My team (Pittsylvania Blue) ended up winning league with Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, and a stockpile of big men and shoot-first guards.  The primary factor in winning this league was a studs-and-duds auction draft.  But that good draft would have been a waste if I hadn't been monitoring the strengths/weaknesses of the entire team and the net effect of free agent moves.</div>

			<div class="repoNote">A viz I built for a fantasy football league draft.  Given some projected stats and an unconventional scoring formula, what positions should be targeted at which points in the draft?  This viz wasn't designed for public use, so there is a regrettable lack of explanation about what's going on.  And the axis labeling is non-existent (a big data visualization no-no).  Also, it turned out that my statistical projections were wildly unreliable, so I did very poorly in this league :).
