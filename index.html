		<h4>2015.09.14 Let's Get This Going</h4>
		<p>I decided the other day that I needed a place where I can put the kind-of-useful stuff
		I build as I'm learning new things and practicing things I think I know.  I tried
		WordPress, but I didn't really want a blog.  I just wanted a chronological list (this page) and a
		portfolio (the <a href="stuff.html">Stuff</a> page).</p>
		<p>So this is that.  More to come.</p>
		<p>Some design notes:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Since I like simplicity, control, and full understanding, the HTML here is completely manual and edited in TextPad.</li>
		<li>I un-div'd this page from an earlier document to clean it up.</li>
		<li>I'm going with cornflower blue because it looks okay with the default HTML link color.  I prefer to use pre-built constants instead of hunting for the perfect hexadecimal code that I'll need to document anyway.</li>
		<li>I learned that I'm not supposed to put an &lt;ul&gt; or an &lt;ol&gt; inside of a &lt;p&gt;.  Stack Overflow to the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5681481/should-ol-ul-be-inside-p-or-outside">rescue</a>.</li>
		<li>I also prefix my working files with the date in YYYY.MM.DD format.  As in "2015.08.15 Research That Weird Sales Order.sql".  So I'm using the same format here.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		On that last point, I am writing with the expectation that I am 95% of my own audience.  And 2% of the audience is seeing how I work.  The other 3% is probably my mother.
		</p>

			<div class="repoNote">I was really happy with how this visualization worked out, and it looks good six months later.  Unlike some of my earlier fantasy sports analysis, I polished these vizzes off with my own conclusion.  The addition of the informed conclusions make the "story" work better for the consumer on the first glance, and the graphic assists with deeper data-gazing.</div>

			<div class="repoNote">A viz I built for a fantasy basketball league sometime in late 2012.  It is hosted on Tableau Public.  This shows which fantasy categories (points, field goal percentage, steals, etc.) a team is doing well or not-so-well in.  My team (Pittsylvania Blue) ended up winning league with Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, and a stockpile of big men and shoot-first guards.  The primary factor in winning this league was a studs-and-duds auction draft.  But that good draft would have been a waste if I hadn't been monitoring the strengths/weaknesses of the entire team and the net effect of free agent moves.</div>

			<div class="repoNote">A viz I built for a fantasy football league draft.  Given some projected stats and an unconventional scoring formula, what positions should be targeted at which points in the draft?  This viz wasn't designed for public use, so there is a regrettable lack of explanation about what's going on.  And the axis labeling is non-existent (a big data visualization no-no).  Also, it turned out that my statistical projections were wildly unreliable, so I did very poorly in this league :).
