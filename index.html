            <h3>2018.09.04 :: Get Git Set Up</h3>
            <p>
            I want each of these exercises to be done in one hour.  I was planning on giving myself 30 minutes to get my Git environment setup and I'm 29 minutes in, and still haven't documented my Git commands or pushed back up to the server.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Here is how I got started:  
                <ol>
                <li>Open Git Bash.  After installing Git, of course.</li>
                <li>Go to the local folder where you want to do your work.  I did mine in simply c:\git</li>
                <li>Run <code>git init</code>.  Then I did <code>git config --global user.name "joedonahoe"</code> and <code>git remote add origin https://github.com/joedonahoe/joedonahoe.github.io</code>.  I had these in an earlier document, but I'm not exactly sure why I needed them.</li>
                <li>Now to pull the existing objects down.  Run <code>git clone https://github.com/joedonahoe/joedonahoe.github.io</code>.</li>
                <li>And run <code>git status</code>.  Nothing has changed.  You can also run "dir -all" to see the files' current state.</li>
                <li>Make some changes.  For me, I used "rm *" to throw away all of the old stuff.  Then I created a new "index.html" in the folder.</li>  
                <li>Run <code>git status</code>, and I have a lot of changes to send to the server.</li>
                <li>Then I ran <code>git commit -a -m "2018 Reboot"</code> and <code>git push origin master</code>.  
                </ol>
            </p>

            <p>
            This is my practice space for Tableau.  Maybe I'll get other tools here (JS, Python, R).  
            But just Tableau for now.  And I'll give myself a time limit so I don't have much time to play and polish things.  
            I will mostly work off of Andy Kriebel's Makeover Monday columns over on <a href="http://www.vizwiz.com">VizWiz</a>.  
            If you have a moment, I would recommend reading Mr. Kriebel's blog.  
            This little site is served up on github.io, and built using handwritten HTML in Visual Studio Code.
