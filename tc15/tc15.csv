Formed a Data Governance Committee to drive data processes
Gained executive sponsorship and support
Discovered previously unknown trends in our data, such as how average check increases impact sales and transaction

1834,Operational Insight at Cisco Systems: Managing Multiple Data Sources in a Complex Organization,"About a year ago, Cisco started a new Engineering Shared Services team. We called this group Platform Design Services (PDS). Now a global team of 800, we provide services to a vast majority of the hardware products developed at Cisco. These services include:

Diagnostics
PCB Layout
Mechanical Design
ECAD/MCAD Tools and Libraries
Signal Integrity and EMC Design
Product Validation Testing

In this presentation we will look at the following questions:

How many people do we have on board today?
What Country do they work in?
What&rsquo;s the break-down between Regular and Contract workers?
What services are they providing?
What are they working on?
How are we staffing project X today? How will that change over next few months?
What is the breakdown between workers funded from our budget and workers funded by other sources?

For smaller companies or teams focused on a handful of customer-facing projects, these questions may seem elementary. However, when you dial the complexity to 800 Engineers working on hundreds of customer-facing projects it&rsquo;s not so straight forward. For Cisco teams focused on a single product family there are standard reports for getting answers to these questions. For PDS (Platform Design Services) there are some added complexities that the standard reports haven&rsquo;t yet taken into consideration. To get the complete picture we needed to improvise. Our approach to getting the complete picture been to develop Python scripts that query several data sources along with some of my own maintained dictionaries. Data sources include:

HR Data from Oracle
Department ownership from a excel report maintained by Finance
Project information and allocation from CA&rsquo;s Clarity for Project and Portfolio Management

Some of these challenges stem from the complexities of the environments (e.g. security), while others are tool-specific training opportunities (e.g. Tableau as a production dashboard vs. a single use data discovery tool). Below are nine tips and tricks, three each from the workbook, server, and process streams that show how IT and content creators can partner on workbook, server and process steps.
Workbooks Optimization:

Workbook complexity: marks, quick filters, views and logical functions.
Data extraction: take what you need for rows and columns.
Security: database vs. localization in workbooks.

Server Optimization:

IT monitoring and management.
Integration of data and data sources.
Metadata management and movement across environments.

Process Optimization:

Exploratory data analysis vs. production deployment.
Robust analytics process that is repeatable and influences change.

1043,Using Tableau to Determine Marketing Attribution at Tableau,"As a marketing department, we know that the majority of prospects who buy our product are influenced by multiple campaign touchpoints&ndash;a banner ad, e-mail, event, etc. The question of marketing attribution is: how do we decide which touchpoints get credit and how do we split that credit? Many of the most popular attribution methods are either too simple (first touch, last touch, linear, etc) or too expensive (third party vendors) and fail to capture the nuances of an individual business. Using Tableau and its new level of detail (LOD) expressions, we are able to leverage our marketing data to create a custom attribution model that estimates how much each marketing campaign contributes to revenue. This gives us a better understanding of the optimal marketing path for a prospect, but more importantly, allows us to calculate a more accurate return on investment (ROI) for each one of our campaigns. Utilizing Tableau makes this process fast, scalable, and dynamic.",10/22/2015 10:15,10/22/2015 11:15,Conference Center Level 1,CC118,"Eric Lee, Mike Braund",Advanced,Breakout Sessions,Using Tableau at Tableau,,,#MarketingAttribution,http://tc15.tableau.com/schedule/thursday/#session-1043,Current as of: 09/10/2015 - 06:46 Subject to change.
